## About

__What is data science?__
Data science has become more than just a hot trend these past few years. The skill of managing and make use of data has proven to be invaluable to industry and personally rewarding. Data science combines statistics, visualizations, and programming to derive meaning from data. Leveraging data in industry maximizes profits, in research it leads to discoveries, and as a hobby it can be a lot of fun.

Some data science projects:
- [Netflix's recommender system](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639)
- [OpenAI generating text (GPT-2)](https://talktotransformer.com)
- [Fighting cancer with machine learning](https://www.cancerdatascience.org)
- [Generating fake people](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com)


__What is this meetup about?__
We will meet at the [Cluhbhouse](https://www.theclubhou.se) to learn and apply the latest data science techniques real world data. The meetups will be structured as a series of demonstrations with collaborative coding in small groups. By attending these meetups, you will expand your skillset and effectively solve problems in your job or personal projects. The meetup material and groupwork will all be programmed in Python, but sharing work in R, Julia, or other languages is welcome.

We will learn:
- Data analytics.
- Visualization.
- Data manipulation.
- Machine learning.
- And anything related to data science.

### Vision
Data science paves roads to the edges of artificial intelligence research that will change the world in our lifetimes. The vision for this group is for us to master the basics of data science and move on to explore advanced topics in artificial intelligence and compete in machine learning in [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com). If we consistently meet, work hard, and foster a welcoming and collaborative environment, we will make this vision a reality.
