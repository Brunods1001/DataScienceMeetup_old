# Data science with Python at the Clubhouse

## About

The goal of this meetup is to learn and apply the latest data science techniques real world data. This meetup will help you expand your skillset and effectively solve problems in your job or personal projects.

We will learn:
- Data analytics.
- Visualization.
- Data manipulation.
- Machine learning.

### Vision
The more we expand our skills, the more we will be able to do. After mastering the basics we will explore advanced topics in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and more. We will also participate in data science competitions like Kaggle. We will also ensure no one gets left behind by fostering a welcoming and collaborative environment.
